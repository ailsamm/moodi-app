# Moodi

Moodi is a versatile app that takes the effort out of keeping a mood journal all while allowing you to track your mood and the different factors that lead to your ups and downs.

Here are some of the perks:
  - Quickly take note of how you felt during a particular day
  - No need to write anything if you don't want to - our quick-tap buttons will help you out
  - Look through your very own journal of mood logs for your own complete history
  - Take a peek at your personalized dashboard to see stats and figures from your recent moods
